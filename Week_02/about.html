            <p style="margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%"> Hi! Nice to meet you! I'm 
            Emily Pham, and I'm a 4th year student studying 
            Asian American Studies and Psychobiology. I'm very passionate about public
            health and want to devote my career to increasing health equity, especially
            for minoritized communties of color. I hope to apply my ethnic studies background
            and passion for public health to improve community and environmental health
            outcomes for people who face health outcomes affected by systemic racism.
            Anyway, we'll see where I end up in a few years, fingers crossed!</p>
            <br>
            <p style="margin-left: 1%; margin-right: 1%""> Some topics at the intersection of 
                community health and the built environment that currently pique my interest are:</p>
                <ul> <li>Addressing inequitable freeway and greenspace development, as well as their effects 
                    on health outcomes </li>
                    <li>Increasing accessibility of public and active transportation options
                    </li>
                    <li>The locality of communities of color, as it relates to racist housing policy,
                        gentrification and displacement, and globalization</li>
                    <li>Food deserts and the (in)accessibility of healthy produce</li>
                </ul>
